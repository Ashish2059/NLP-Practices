One of the biggest advantages of ASP.NET is its flexibility and object-oriented features.\\n\\n\\nFigure : .Net, .Net Core and Mono Framework\\n.Net Core:\\nDevelopers describe\\xa0ASP.NET Core\\xa0as \"A cross-platform .NET framework for building modern cloud-based web applications on Windows, Mac, or Linux\". A free and open-source web framework, and higher performance than ASP.NET, developed by Microsoft and the community. It is a modular framework that runs on both the full .NET Framework, on Windows, and the cross-platform .NET Core.\\nUses of .Net Core:\\nCommand-line applications:\\nAt the most basic level, .NET Core is a console applications that can be interested with via a command-line interface, such as Windows Command Prompt or Linux Terminal. So, if you need to build an OS-independent command-line application.\\nWeb applications:\\nASP.NET Core, the set of libraries that enable development of web applications on top of .NET Core, is way easier to work with than mono equivalent, while it can do everything mono can and more.\\nThrough trial and error, Microsoft developers made it possible to set up basic web applications in minutes with easily configurable\\xa0middleware pipeline.\\nAlso, with revamped version of SignalR library and\\xa0server-side Blazor. you can now maintain a persistent real-time two-way communication between your client and server components with very little code required.\\nBackground services:\\nAny application that runs continuously in the background and doesn’t have GUI can be classed as a service. And .NET Core allows you to build such applications just as easily as you can build some basic console apps.\\nDesktop applications:\\nOn the other hand, if you want to make your desktop application for multiple operating systems, .NET Core may still be the best choice. There is a great cross-platform JavaScript framework for building desktop applications called\\xa0Electron.js\\xa0and with\\xa0Electron.NET\\xa0NuGet package, you can integrate it with your .NET Core app.\\nThe unique selling point of this approach is that your entire GUI is done in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, just like a web page. The only difference is that all of it is hosted on your machine inside the desktop application itself. And, instead of being displayed in the browser, it’s displayed in its own window.\\nUses of Mono:\\nMobile app development:\\nUsing .NET for mobile app development was always focus for Xamarin since its inception, so without a doubt, this is where you will be using mono. That is, of course, unless you opt for writing the apps in their native languages, which would be either\\xa0\\xa0or\\xa0\\xa0for Android and either\\xa0\\xa0or\\xa0\\xa0for iOS.\\nIf you do opt to go native, however, you will be only able to write your code for one OS at a time. With mono-based Xamarin tools, on the other hand, you can have a single code base, which you can compile for both Android and iOS.\\nGame development:\\nUnity gaming engine uses mono inside of it, so mono is the official way of getting your .NET code into games.\\n.NET Core, on the other hand, was never intended for gaming. So, unless you want to build a text-based adventure or some relatively basic browser-based game, .NET Core is of no use.\\nCompiled code inside browser:\\nWebAssembly allows you to run a compiled code inside browser. Unlike other technologies, such as Silverlight, Java and Flash that required vendor-specific browser plugins, WebAssembly is a web standard. And as such, it’s supported by all major browsers.\\nMono has\\xa0\\xa0to be compiled into WebAssembly-compatible packages. And, as such, it was a natural choice for the base framework behind\\xa0.\\nMulti-platform desktop applications:\\nDesktop applications on operating systems other than Windows was the reason why mono was developed in the first place. Since then, countless frameworks and libraries were built around it to accommodate GUI-based application development on Windows, Linux, Mac OS and even Solaris.\\nAsp.Net Web Forms and Asp.Net MVC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsp.Net Core\\nAsp.net Core is a new version of Asp.net released by Microsoft. It is an open-source used to develop a web framework and can be executed with different browsers like Windows, Mac or Linux. ASP.Net Core is a new version of asp.net. It is a free open source which can run on different OS like Mac, Windows and Linux. It was originally launched as an ASP.NET 5 but later it was renamed to ASP.NET Core and still with the same name.\\n\\nFigure : Asp.Net Core Framework\\nAsp.Net Core is a cloud-based cross-platform framework to build web apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux including the\\xa0\\nMVC framework\\n\\xa0. It is a combination of MVC and WEB API in a single web programming framework.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor Benefits of ASP.Net Core:\\nAsp.Net core is a much leaner and modular framework because of multiple of architecture\\nAsp.net Core is an open-source framework.\\nEasy to build cross-platform asp.net app on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\\nThe configuration is a cloud-ready environment.\\nAbility to host on:\\nA) Kestral\\nB) IIS\\nC) HTTP.sys\\nD) Nginx\\nE) Apache\\nF) Docker\\n\\nDifference between Asp.Net and Asp.Net Core\\n\\nWEB API\\nWeb API is an application programming interface (API) that is used to enable communication or interaction with software components with each other. ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP Service that reaches a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. Using ASP.NET, web API can enable communicating by different devices from the same database.\\n\\n\\nUses of Web API\\nIt is used to access service data in web applications as well as many mobile apps and other external devices.\\nIt is used to create RESTful web services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for networked hypermedia applications.\\nIt is primarily used to build Web Services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable, and support limited bandwidth.\\nIt is used to create a simple HTTP Web Service. It supports XML, JSON, and other data formats.\\nBenefits of Web API:\\nCentralization of business logic will lessen your efforts, making your work worthwhile.\\xa0\\nThese RESTful Web APIs are accessible by a variety of HTTP clients like Windows 7, Windows 8, Android, iPhone, iPad, WPF Client, Windows Phone 8 etc.\\nIt is an open source.\\nIt uses low bandwidth. (XML or JSON data). We can also pass html content if required.\\nWeb API Controller pattern is much similar to MVC Controller. Thus, it becomes easy to maintain and understand.\\nDevelopment using Web API itself makes a separation from UI Development.\\nIt is a lightweight architecture and is good for devices, which have limited bandwidth like smart cell phones.\\nIts work is based on HTTP and is easy to define, expose and occupy in a RESTful way.\\nIt uses URIs for identifying information paths (resources)\\nIt also has message headers that are very meaningful and descriptive — headers that suggest us that the content type of the message’s body, headers that explain how to secure it, how to cache information etc.\\nSecure API endpoints with built-in support for industry standard JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Policy-based authorization gives you the flexibility to define powerful access control rules—all in code.\\n\\n.Net Architecture\\n\\nFigure : .Net Framework Architechture\\nDetails refer Chapter 1:\\n.NET is tiered, modular, and hierarchal. Each tier of the .NET Framework is a layer of abstraction. .NET languages are the top tier and the most abstracted level. The common language runtime is the bottom tier, the least abstracted, and closest to the native environment. This is important since the common language runtime works closely with the operating environment to manage .NET applications. The .NET Framework is partitioned into modules, each with its own distinct responsibility. Finally, since higher tiers request services only from the lower tiers, .NET is hierarchal. The architectural layout of the .NET Framework is given below.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Figure:\\xa0An overview of the .NET architecture.\\nCommon Language Runtime (CLR)\\xa0is the heart of the .Net Framework. It resides above the operating system and handles all .Net applications. It handles garbage collection, Code Access Security (CAS) etc.\\nCommon Language Infrastructure (CLI)\\xa0provides a language-independent platform for app development and its performance. It also includes the function for exception handling, waste collection, security, etc.\\nCommon Type System(CTS)\\xa0specifies a standard that represent what type of data and value can be defined and managed in computer memory at runtime. For example, in C# we define data type as int, while in VB.NET we define integer as a data type.\\nCommon language Specification(CLS)\\xa0 is a subset of common type system (CTS) that defines a set of rules and regulations which should be followed by every language that comes under the .net framework. For example, in C# and VB.NET language, the C# language terminate each statement with semicolon, whereas in VB.NET it is not end with semicolon, and when these statements execute in .NET Framework, it provides a common platform to interact and share information with each other.\\nFCL (Framework Class Library)\\xa0provides the various system functionality in the .NET Framework, that includes classes, interfaces and data types, etc. to create multiple functions and different types of application such as desktop, web, mobile application, etc.\\nDesign principles of .NET:\\nInteroperability\\nPortability\\nIn-built security mechanism\\nRobust memory management\\nSimplified deployment\\nAsynchronous Programming\\nHigh Performance\\n\\n.Net Design Principle\\nDevelopers start building applications with good and tidy designs using their knowledge and experience. But over time, applications might\\xa0develop bugs. The application design must be altered for every change request or new feature request. After some time we might need to put in a lot of effort, even for simple tasks and it might require full working knowledge of the entire system. But we can\\'t blame change or new feature requests. They are part of software development. We can\\'t stop them or refuse them either. So who is the culprit here? Obviously it is the design of the application.\\n\\xa0\\nThe following are the design flaws that cause damage in software, mostly.\\nPutting more stress on classes by assigning more responsibilities to them. (A lot of functionality not related to a class.)\\nForcing the classes to depend on each other. If classes are dependent on each other (in other words tightly coupled), then a change in one will affect the other.\\nSpreading duplicate code in the system/application.\\nSolution\\nChoosing the correct architecture (in other words MVC, 3-tier, Layered, MVP, MVVP and so on).\\nFollowing Design Principles.\\nChoosing correct Design Patterns to build the software based on its specifications.\\nSOLID principles are the design principles that enable us to manage most of the software design problems. Robert C. Martin compiled these principles in the 1990s. These principles provide us with ways to move from tightly coupled code and little encapsulation to the desired results of loosely coupled and encapsulated real needs of a business properly. SOLID is an acronym of the following.\\nS: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\\nO: Open closed Principle (OSP)\\nL: Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)\\nI: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\\nD: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\\nS: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\\nSRP says \"Every software module should have only one reason to change\".\\nThis means that every class, or similar structure, in your code should have only one job to do. Everything in that class should be related to a single purpose. Our class should not be like a Swiss knife wherein if one of them needs to be changed then the entire tool needs to be altered. It does not mean that your classes should only contain one method or property. There may be many members as long as they relate to single responsibility.\\nO: Open/Closed Principle\\nHere \"Open for extension\" means, we need to design our module/class in such a way that the new functionality can be added only when new requirements are generated. \"Closed for modification\" means we have already developed a class and it has gone through unit testing. We should then not alter it until we find bugs.\\nL: Liskov Substitution Principle\\nThe Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that \"you should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification\". It ensures that a derived class does not affect the behavior of the parent class, in other words,, that a derived class must be substitutable for its base class.\\nThis principle is just an extension of the Open Closed Principle and it means that we must ensure that new derived classes extend the base classes without changing their behavior.\\xa0For example: A father is a doctor whereas his son wants to become a cricketer. So here the son can\\'t replace his father even though they both belong to the same family hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n\\nI: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\\nThe Interface Segregation Principle states \"that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don\\'t use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule.\".\\nSuppose we need to build a system for an IT firm that contains roles like TeamLead and Programmer where TeamLead divides a huge task into smaller tasks and assigns them to his/her programmers or can directly work on them.\\nD: Dependency Inversion Principle\\nThe Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.\\n.NET CLI: build, run, test and deploy .NET Core Applications\\nNET CLI Commands\\n\\nCLI having different commands (that includes Basic command set, Project Modification command set and Advanced command set) that helps to create a base or a foundation, that will support IDE, editors and tools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRun Command:\\nThis command is used to run application, it is very helpful for rapid development from command line, the output of the application is written to the default location that is bin/<configuration>/<target> the syntax is dotnet run, If you want to run any specific project then the syntax would be\\n dotnet run –project\\nbuild Command:\\nThis command is used to build a project with all its dependencies, The syntax is as simple\\n dotnet build [<PROJECT>]\\nThe example, dotnet build[<PROJECT>, is the path of project that needs to be build, by default it takes current path as project path]\\ntest Command:\\nThis command is used to execute Unit Test Cases basically it’s a console that support unit test runner, the output of the command is result of each test case that is fail or pass, The syntax is\\n dotnet test [<PROJECT>]\\nThe example, dotnet test[<Project> is the project path which is optional, default path is current directory]\\n\\nGoto run type cmd\\nSpecify location where we want to generate project.\\nType  dotnet new console\\n\\nIt will generate the following shown in picture.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://danpatrascu.com/deploy-net-core-application-command-line/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":121}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Collecting

processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.  The goal is a computer capable of \"understanding\" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.\n","\n","Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.\n","\n","Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\n","\n","The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\n","\n","Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[7]\n","\n","In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[8][9] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[10] and parsing.[11][12] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care.[13]\n","\n","In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by symbolic methods, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules, coupled with a dictionary lookup:[14][15] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.\n","\n","More recent systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules: \n","\n","Despite the popularity of machine learning in NLP research, symbolic methods are still (2020) commonly used:\n","\n","Since the so-called \"statistical revolution\"[16][17] in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning. The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora (the plural form of corpus, is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations) of typical real-world examples.\n","\n","Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of \"features\" that are generated from the input data. Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature (complex-valued embeddings,[18] and neural networks in general have also been proposed, for e.g. speech[19]). Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.\n","\n","Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if–then rules similar to existing handwritten rules.  However, part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.\n","\n","Since the neural turn, statistical methods in NLP research have been largely replaced by neural networks. However, they continue to be relevant for contexts in which statistical interpretability and transparency is required.\n","\n","A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[20] the field has thus largely abandoned statistical methods and shifted to neural networks for machine learning. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation (SMT).\n","\n","The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\n","\n","Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.\n","\n","Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[41]\n","\n","Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).\n","\n","Cognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[42] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[43] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[44] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.\n","\n","As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[45] with two defining aspects:\n","\n","Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[47] functional grammar,[48] construction grammar,[49] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[50] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[51] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit).[52]\n","\n"]}]}]}
